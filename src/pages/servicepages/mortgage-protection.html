          <p class="cs-item-p">
            Mortgage Protection Insurance is a specialized life insurance policy designed to pay off your mortgage or provide mortgage payments to your family in the event of your death, disability, or job loss. It ensures your family can keep their home during difficult times.
          </p>

        <li class="cs-faq-item">
          <button class="cs-button">How does Mortgage Protection differ from regular life insurance?</button>
          <p class="cs-item-p">
            While regular life insurance provides a lump sum to beneficiaries, Mortgage Protection Insurance is specifically designed to cover mortgage-related expenses. It can be structured to decrease as your mortgage balance decreases and may include additional riders for disability and job loss protection.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="cs-faq-item">
          <button class="cs-button">Can I get coverage for disability and job loss?</button>
          <p class="cs-item-p">
            Yes, many Mortgage Protection Insurance policies offer optional riders for disability coverage and job loss protection. These riders can help cover your mortgage payments if you become disabled or lose your job, providing additional financial security for your family.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="cs-faq-item">
          <button class="cs-button">How much coverage do I need?</button>
          <p class="cs-item-p">
            Your coverage amount should match your current mortgage balance or the amount you want to protect. We can help you determine the right coverage amount based on your mortgage balance, family needs, and budget considerations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="cs-faq-item">
          <button class="cs-button">What happens if I pay off my mortgage early?</button>
          <p class="cs-item-p">
            If you have a decreasing term policy, the coverage amount decreases as you pay down your mortgage. If you pay off your mortgage early, you may be able to convert the policy to a different type of life insurance or cancel it, depending on the policy terms and your needs.
